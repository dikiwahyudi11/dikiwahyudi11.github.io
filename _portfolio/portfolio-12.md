### Introduction
This project is conducted as part of the course "Econometrics". Econometric studies play a crucial role in understanding the intricate relationships within regional economies, often relying on secondary data obtained from authoritative sources like the Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS). This study delves into the economic dynamics of the East Java Province, Indonesia, utilizing data encompassing the Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP), Human Development Index (HDI), labor force participation, and educational attainment across its 34 regencies and cities. Employing a simultaneous equation model, this research aims to elucidate the interplay between these key indicators and offer insights into policy implications for regional development strategies.

### Methods
The methodology employed in this study hinges upon a simultaneous equation model, a potent analytical tool capable of unraveling the complex relationships between multiple variables. Leveraging data sourced from the BPS East Java Province, the model is constructed to simultaneously estimate the determinants of GRDP and HDI. The estimation process utilizes the Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) method, enabling robust parameter estimates while addressing potential endogeneity issues inherent in the simultaneous equation framework. Through this rigorous approach, the study endeavors to discern the nuanced interactions between GRDP, HDI, labor force participation, and educational attainment, thereby offering a comprehensive understanding of the regional economic landscape.

### Key Findings
1. The simultaneous equation model reveals significant influences of Human Development Index (HDI) and labor force participation on Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP), indicating the multidimensional nature of economic growth in East Java Province.
2. Conversely, the analysis underscores the importance of GRDP and educational attainment in shaping HDI, emphasizing the interconnectedness between economic advancement and human development outcomes.
3. Despite achieving a commendable $$R^2$$ value of 0.66628, the GRDP equation exhibits violations of certain assumptions of the simultaneous equation model, suggesting potential misspecification or omitted variable bias.
