### Introduction
This project is conducted as part of the course "Genomic Data Science". Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying prostate cancer progression is essential for developing effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. The NCBI dataset `GDS2546` provides a valuable resource for investigating the genomic signatures associated with metastatic and primary prostate tumors, as well as adjacent normal tissue samples. With a comprehensive collection of 12,620 genes across 167 samples, this dataset offers a rich landscape for unraveling the intricate interplay between genetic alterations and disease progression in prostate cancer. Leveraging advanced data analysis techniques such as clustering, biclustering, and classification, this study aims to elucidate distinct molecular subtypes, identify potential biomarkers, and uncover novel insights into the pathogenesis of prostate cancer.

### Methods
The analysis methodology encompasses clustering, biclustering, and classification techniques tailored for high-dimensional genomic data. Clustering algorithms such as $$k$$-means or hierarchical clustering will be employed to identify inherent patterns and group samples based on similar gene expression profiles. Biclustering, a specialized clustering approach, will be utilized to identify subsets of genes that exhibit coherent expression patterns across a subset of samples, allowing for the identification of gene sets associated specifically with prostate cancer subtypes or disease stages.

Furthermore, classification algorithms, including support vector machines (SVM), random forests, or neural networks, will be deployed to develop predictive models for distinguishing between metastatic and primary prostate tumors, as well as normal and tumor-adjacent tissue samples. These models will be trained on the gene expression data, utilizing features selected through feature selection techniques such as recursive feature elimination or principal component analysis to enhance model performance and interpretability.

Through the integration of these advanced analytical approaches, this study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the molecular landscape of prostate cancer progression, offering valuable insights that may guide future research directions and clinical interventions aimed at improving patient outcomes.
