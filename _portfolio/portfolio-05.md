### Introduction
This project is conducted as part of the course "Data Mining and Business Intelligence". The real estate market in Indonesia is dynamic and multifaceted, driven by factors such as economic growth, urbanization, and changing consumer preferences. Understanding the underlying trends and patterns within this market is crucial for stakeholders ranging from property developers to investors and policymakers. In this project, we leverage a dataset containing housing prices in Indonesia, encompassing various attributes such as land area, building area, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, garage and carport capacity, location details, certification type, electricity capacity, orientation, and listing date. With the aid of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we aim to uncover insights into the factors influencing housing prices, identify key trends, and provide actionable intelligence for decision-making in the real estate sector.

### Methods
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) serves as the cornerstone methodology for uncovering patterns and trends within the housing dataset. This analytical approach involves a systematic examination of the dataset's structure, summary statistics, and visualizations to gain insights into the distribution, relationships, and outliers within the data.

Initially, descriptive statistics will be calculated to summarize the central tendencies, dispersion, and variability of each variable, providing an overview of the dataset's characteristics. Subsequently, graphical techniques such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots will be utilized to visualize the distributions, correlations, and patterns among the variables. These visualizations will help identify potential trends, outliers, and relationships between housing attributes and prices.
