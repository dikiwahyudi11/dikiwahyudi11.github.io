### Introduction
This project is conducted as part of the course "Databases for Data Science". This project aims to create a spare parts database.

### Methods
Creating a spare parts database entails a series of essential steps. Initially, it begins with comprehending the requirements of the spare parts inventory system. This involves identifying the necessary entities such as parts, suppliers, and orders, as well as their relationships to design a suitable schema. Once the schema is conceptualized, normalization is applied to minimize redundancy and uphold data integrity within the database. Subsequently, SQL scripts are crafted to generate tables, define relationships, and implement constraints based on the devised schema. These scripts are then executed on the chosen database management system (DBMS), in this case SQLite, to establish the spare parts database. Thorough testing is subsequently conducted to validate that the database structure aligns with the intended functionality, ensuring accurate management of spare parts inventory. Finally, ongoing maintenance is crucial to monitor database performance, incorporate any necessary schema modifications, and guarantee data consistency throughout its lifecycle.
